* Introduction

This feature allows institute administrators to add student data in bulk
conveniently. During the bulk upload process, administrators are required only
to provide the essential data and the students themselves can complete their
profile upon receiving their login information.

Upon uploading the XLSX, the students that can be added to the database are added,
and the additions that fail are presented with the reason of failure. The
password of the newly created accounts is =practease123= and the students are
expected to change it to their liking.

* Accessing the Feature

After logging in to the [[https://engine.practease.in/school/login][Practease Institute Module]], the feature can be accessed
by clicking on the "Upload via XLSX" button under the "Students Management"
view.

* Requirements

This feature takes input only in the form of a Microsoft Excel XLSX file built
upon a template that can be [[https://engine.practease.in/assets/files/bulk_upload_template.xlsx][found here]]. A link to the template is also available
on the upload form.

The template has seven columns, all of which are required:

- Name :: The name of the student
- Class :: The class that the student belongs to. The class name should be
  exactly the same as it's entered in the Practease database or the entry will
  be rejected. As of now, it can have the following four values:
  - 12th
  - 11th
  - 10th
  - 9th
- Section :: The section of the class that the student belongs to. The section
  entered must be exactly the same as entered in the database or the student
  won't be added to the database. For example, Section A.
- Email :: The email at which the student can be reached.
- Admission No. :: The admission number of the student as registered at the
  institution. Each student at a institute must have a unique admission no. or the
  entry will be rejected.
- Role /[sic]/ No. :: The roll of the student for the class they are in.
- Phone No. :: A phone number at which the student can be reached. Must be ten
   digits long or the entry will be rejected.

* Usage

The upload form looks like this:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 100px
[[./images/upload_form.png]]

Click on "Browse" to select an XLSX file for upload. Then, click on "Upload" to
upload the file. Keep in mind that only a valid XLSX file will be accepted by
the form.

Following this, the XLSX will be processed and the rows of student data will be
attempted to add the student database. The resulting screen will show up to two
tables:

- The first one will show the students that were successfully added to the
  database.
- The second one will show the entries that failed to be inserted, along with
  the reason for failure.

For example, for the following input:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 200px
[[./images/sample_upload.png]]

The following output will be produced:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 200px
